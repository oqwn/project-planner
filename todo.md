## WebSocket Architecture Analysis (2025-07-22)

### Current WebSocket Implementation:
- ✅ Frontend WebSocket Service: `chatWebSocketService.ts` using @stomp/stompjs and SockJS
- ✅ Backend WebSocket Config: Spring Boot with STOMP message broker
- ✅ WebSocket Endpoints: `/ws-chat` for connection, `/app/chat.send` for messages
- ✅ Message Routing: Conversation-based messaging with `/topic/conversation/{id}/messages`
- ✅ User Presence: Real-time online/offline status updates via `/topic/presence`
- ✅ Authentication: JWT token-based auth with Bearer tokens in WebSocket headers

### WebSocket Message Flow:
1. **Frontend sends message via WebSocket**: 
   - Destination: `/app/chat.send`
   - Payload: `{ conversationId, content, type, mentions }`
   
2. **Backend WebSocketChatController receives message**:
   - Extracts user from Principal
   - Creates ChatMessage entity
   - Saves to database via ChatService
   
3. **Backend broadcasts message**:
   - To conversation topic: `/topic/conversation/{conversationId}/messages`
   - To user's personal topic: `/topic/user/{userEmail}/messages`
   
4. **Frontend receives and displays message**:
   - ChatWebSocketManager handles connection lifecycle
   - EnhancedChat component subscribes to message handlers
   - Messages appear in real-time in the UI

### Key Findings:
- WebSocket messages are processed entirely through WebSocket (no HTTP fallback needed)
- Messages are persisted to database before broadcasting
- Dual broadcasting ensures users receive messages even when not in specific conversation
- Connection management includes automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Frontend has proper handler registration/cleanup to prevent memory leaks
